# STAT628-Module2

This repository consists of three folders:
1. data

This folder has the original body fat data (BodyFat.csv) of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements. It also has the cleaned data cleaned_data.csv that removes the two outlier data.
   
2. code

This folder has the r code file (group8.R) to run analysis, produce figures, the r code file (shinyApp.R) to generate a Shiny app, and the r code file (variableSelection.R) to explain variable selection for our model based on the dataset. Note: All of these r codes read the BodyFat.csv instead of cleaned_data.csv as they all include the steps of data cleaning.
   
3. image

This folder contains the images and figures generated from group_8.R.
