# STAT628-Module2

This repository consists of three folders:
1. data
   This folder has the original body fat data (BodyFat.csv) of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements. It also has the cleaned data cleaned_data.csv that removes the two outlier data.
   
3. code
   This folder has the r code to run analysis (group8.R), produce figures and generate a Shiny app based on the dataset. Note: it reads the BodyFat.csv instead of cleaned_data.csv as it includes the steps of data cleaning.
   
5. image
   This folder contains the images and figures generated from group_8.R.
